# word-guess-game
A word guess game utilizing javascript
## OVERVIEW
This is a web browser game where the player is given a random word from a list of ten 1980s slang words.

Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygene 4 plays in the background

Sound clips from the movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High play on events where the player is successful, fails and when the game ends.
